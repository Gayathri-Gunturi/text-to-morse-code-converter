The Text-to-Morse Converter is a tool that converts plain text into Morse code. The project includes two versions:

Python-based Console Version: A simple command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python for quick text-to-Morse conversion.

Web-based Version: A modern web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to convert text into Morse code directly from the browser.

Features
Python Version:
  Converts plain text into Morse code using a Python script.
  Supports alphanumeric characters and basic punctuation (as per Morse code standards).
  Handles invalid characters gracefully by notifying the user.

Web Version:
  Converts plain text into Morse code using a browser-based interface.
  Supports alphanumeric characters and basic punctuation.
  Features an interactive web design with a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
  Handles invalid characters and displays only valid Morse code.
  Uses JavaScript to process the text and display the result dynamically.

How It Works
Python Version:
  The user inputs a string of text in the console.
  The Python script maps each character to its corresponding Morse code equivalent using a predefined dictionary.
  The resulting Morse code is displayed in the console.

Web Version:
  The user enters a string of text in an input field on the webpage.
  Clicking the "Convert to Morse Code" button triggers a JavaScript function that maps each character to Morse code.
  The resulting Morse code is displayed directly on the page.
