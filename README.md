The Text-to-Morse Converter is a Python-based program that converts text input into Morse code. This project is implemented without any GUI libraries like Tkinter, focusing purely on console-based functionality for simplicity and ease of use.

Features
Converts plain text into Morse code.
Supports alphanumeric characters and basic punctuation (as per Morse code standards).
Handles invalid characters gracefully by notifying the user.

How It Works
The user inputs a string of text via the console.
The program maps each character to its corresponding Morse code equivalent using a predefined dictionary.
The resulting Morse code is displayed in the console.
